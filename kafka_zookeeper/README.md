# Kafka Zookeeper Fast 3 Broker Deployment
In this setup, youâ€™ll run a **3-broker Zookeeper cluster** in Zookeeper mode.  
- The [Kafka UI (Provectus)](http://localhost:8080) is available for topic/cluster management.  
- All configuration files (`*.properties` and `*.yml`) are in the `config` folder.

> **Note:** This deployment makes it easy to spin up and manage a multi-broker Kafka cluster for development or testing.
